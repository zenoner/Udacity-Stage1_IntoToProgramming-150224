    </div>
    <div class="Description">
      <p>
        <b>HTML</b> can create the text content, markup, and references to other documents, such as images & videos, link to another web page. 
      </p>

      <p><b>HTML</b> markup consists of an opening tag and closing tags. The entire piece of code is called an <i>element</i>. Attributes are listed after the elements, but before the corresponding value.
Images and links are self-closing and are considered void tags, because they don't contain content.  </p>

          More information about HTML
    </div>
    <div class="Description">
      <p><b>HTML Whitespace</b> can turn everything into one line. Using <i>br tag</i> can seperate the content into multiple lines. Using <i>p tag</i> is another option but it is great for paragraphy. </p>
      <p><i>Inline and Block elements</i> are used to seperate content. An example of an inline element would be br tag because it just adds a break in the HTML line and wraps remaining text to the next line. An example of a block element would be p tag because it creates an invisible box around the content. Block elements also have a height and width. </p>

          Revaluate the BOX
    </div>
    <div class="Description">
      <p>We know that everything on a webpage is made up of a box.</p> <p>Which consists of 4 parts:
Content- this is the image or text that appears on the website, comparable to the nucleus of the box, the other layers serve to protect it so other things don't get to close or overlap
Padding- this clears an area around the content, is affected by background color, and is the space that protects the content directly
Border- inherits color property of box, incases the padding and content
Margin- goes around border, outer most layer, provides space between boxes, transparent.</p>

    <p>Compare your HTML document to the design you were created. How to know what to change?
Get page structure right, by visually boxifying it
Look for natural boxes
Move on to tags(make heading h1)
Look for repeated styles & semantic elements
Size of boxes, how big, and how to position
Write html
Apply styles(biggest to smallest)
Fix things!
      Repeat steps above till it looks like the design mock up! </p>
